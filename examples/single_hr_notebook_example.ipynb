    "+ It must support Bluetooth, not just ANT+\n",
    "+ The GATT Characteristic required is: `00002a37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`\n",
    "+ You may use the [`bluetooth_dissect.py` tool](https://github.com/tensorturtle/bluetooth_dissect) to check if your device supports that GATT Characteristic.\n",

    "+ Magene H603\n",

    "+ Make sure your computer's bluetooth adapter is powered on.\n",
